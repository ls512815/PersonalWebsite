      <p>
          I currently work at the Office of Information <br>
          Technology at Ohio University where I am the <br>
          primary point of contact for application and <br>
          general computing issues. I am also an <br>
          Engineering Ambassador for the Russ College  <br>
          of Engineering which entails leading student <br>
          recruitment tours, promoting the college to <br>
          parents, alumni and friends of the college, 
          <br>and networking with distinguished alumni <br>
          at special events.
          <br> <br> 
          Before these two jobs I was a Learning <br>
          Community Leader where I led a class of <br>
          Computer Science freshman students and <br>
          helped provide an inclusive environment <br>
          where students can grow throughout their <br>
          freshman year.
          <br> <br>
          Over the summer of 2019 I interned in Chicago <br>
          at a company called Softchoice. While there I <br>
          was a technology Sales Intern where I engaged <br>
          in a four-week training program encompassing <br>
          sales strategy, complex product knowledge, and <br>
          industry best practices. During my time working <br>
          with Softchoice we were working closely with <br>
          companies such as Microsoft, Google, Dell, and <br>
          Veeam to learn the ins and outs of their Company.

  <h4 id="Outside"> Outside Interests </h4>
<p > 
          Outside of school and work I enjoy things like <br>
          traveling, hiking, and spending time with friends <br>
          and family. <br><br>

          I studied abroad in Prague, Czech Reupublic the <br>
          summer after my sophmore year of college. Although <br>
          it was scary to go to a foreign country on my own, <br>
          this was one of the best summers of my life with so <br>
          many incredible opportunities. I was able to make <br>
          life long friends and was fortunate enough to have <br>
          traveled to 9 different countries in the 8 weeks <br>
          that I was in Europe. I hope to keep traveling <br>
          throughout my life and find more amazing places <br>
          to visit. <br> <br>

          During my summer abroad, I went to Switzerland <br>
          which was filled with breathtaking hikes and great <br>
          company. My family and I went hiking in Zermatt, <br>
          where we could see the Matterhorn and the other <br>
          beauties of Switzerland. Although these were the <br>
          most beautiful sites, my favorite place to go <br>
          hiking is Hocking Hills which is right around <br>
          the corner from OU. My friends and I try to go<br>
          hiking as often as possible and are planning a <br>
          trip to visit all the national parks in and around <br>
          Colorado after Graduation. <br><br>

          Other interests include: Reading, visiting art <br>
          museums, snowboarding, and going to concerts. I <br>
          also enjoy being creative whether it's making this <br> 
          webpage for myself or painting with friends, I love <br>
          finding new ways to express myself. <br><br>
